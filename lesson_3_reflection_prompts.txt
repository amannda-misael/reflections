When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are sharing your project with other people or you need to access it from diferent locals.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because in some commits the new function or bug fix is not completed yet and not ready to be shared
